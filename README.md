# Challenge 4: Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

This week, I given a starter code and was tasked with creating a Work Day Scheduler that consisted of three rows that included the times, tasks, and save button, respectively. There was a css style sheet that was already created for me, but I had to appoint the correct style classes onto their designated elements. The functionality was comprised of being able to type in an event in the center column and then hit the save button which would save the task to local storage, so that when the page is refreshed, the task would still remain showing on the page. Additionally for the tasks, the background color of all past times should appear grey, the background of the current time should appear red, and the backgrounds of all future times should appear green. This webpage should also show the current date at the top of the page under the title of the page.
